# http-server


**Author** : Jay Adams
**Version**: 0.1.0

## Overview
Working with http

## Getting Started
Set up your ENV, and install a package calledÂ cowsay. Cowsay, in Python, makes pies. One file, easily embedded into your app. It's directly executable and can be used on the CLI much like the original Cowsay. Or it can be used as a Python module that is imported into a Python program. It also has the option to copy itself so you can easily distribute it embedded into your own package.
Use Insomnia as the GUI to visially test the output form the server and cowpy.
